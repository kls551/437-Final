### Description
We plan to make a Housing Posting Webapp using Rest and AngularJS front end. In our WebApp, users will need to register an account for posting their housing. Users can make a post, or posts for their properties with details such as housing descriptions, price, photos and contact info. Users will use email or phone number to communicate and negotiate. On the main page, there will be a list of posting sorted by the posting date, and users will be able to click on the posting to get the details such as images, description, posterâ€™s email, and phone number.

We can implement a sorting option where users will be able to limit the list either by the price range (maybe by a slider), or numbers of bedrooms in the house, so that users will be able to browse their requirements easier.
